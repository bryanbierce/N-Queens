### What is this?

This started with an experiment with web-workers. I was given the idea to use the N-Queens solution as a way to try using web-workers and learned a lot doing so. It ignited an smoldering curiousity in concurrent languages and this is now become a place to co-locate my samples of writing concurrent processes in different languages.

If you are here please feel free to shoot me some feedback on any of the implementations you find. The other languages here are all entirely new to me and I sincerely doubt I will hit on idiomatic solutions in any of them. My goal is to spend just enough time with each to be able to implement a sequential and concurrent solution, get a taste for the language and decide which I might like to dive deeper into.
